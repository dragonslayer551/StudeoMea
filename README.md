# SacHacksStudeo

This is a submission to SacHacks 2021 Edition!

The spiel: As students, we remain to be confined to a 13 inch LED screen to communicate and interact, it has been difficult to find a constant community, a space to play, learn, study and be an individual. As a result, we created Studeo Mea which is an Android Audio App which is a virtual space to study, share resources, discover interests, discuss them with friends and meet new ones. Users can easily find and connect with others who have similar taste, interest and personality which is based on a taste test conducted on a Spotify Machine Learning analysis. ðŸŒ³ Here is the repo:
